# 👋 Hi, I'm Joseph Corritone

🎓 I'm a second-year student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison studying **Data Science** and **Economics**, with a minor in **Business** and a strong interest in **predictive metrics** in sports.

📊 I love exploring how past data provides insight into performance, strategy, and decision-making in sports. I'm passionate about applying analysis to real-world problems across different leagues and levels of competition.

⚽ I'm especially interested in:

🏀 Team performance metrics  
⚾ Salary cap & roster optimization  
🏈 Game strategy and play-by-play data  

🛠️ **Language I primarily use:**
- R (ggplot2, dplyr)

📁 **What you'll find here**:  
This GitHub is for my personal projects and experiments in sports analytics. I'll be posting deep dives into team data, statistical modeling projects, and explorations of data-driven sports insights.
