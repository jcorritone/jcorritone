# 👋 Hi, I'm Joseph Corritone

🎓 I'm a third-year student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison studying **Data Science** and **Economics**, with a certificate in **Business** and a strong interest in **predictive metrics** in sports.

📊 I love exploring how past data provides insight into performance, strategy, and decision-making in sports. I'm passionate about applying analysis to real-world problems across different leagues and levels of competition.

⚽🏀🏈⚾ I'm especially interested in:
- Team performance metrics  
- Salary cap & roster optimization  
- Game strategy and play-by-play data    

🛠️ **Languages I primarily use:**
- R (dplyr, ggplot2)
- Python (pandas)

📁 **What you'll find here**:  
This GitHub is for my personal projects and experiments in sports analytics. I'll be posting deep dives into team data, statistical modeling projects, and explorations of data-driven sports insights.
